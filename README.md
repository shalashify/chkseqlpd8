# Sample Sequencer using Akai LPD8 as Conrtoller

Sampler sequencer that uses Akai LPD-8 as controller. I have implemented back in 2016 and have not used it in recent years and now I don't own an LPD8 to test it, so it is provided as-is, maybe someone would find some of its parts useful when learning Chuck.

# Functions

- Drum patterns can be configured on the fly using LPD8 Sequencer input
- Supports loading drum sample sets and drum pattern presets
- Output to LPD8 highights the pads that are playing
- One MIDI device can be clocked
- Recording funtionality is provided by an external Chuck Script rec.ck
